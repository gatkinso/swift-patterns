This is discussion #28 from "Design Patterns in Swift" on Udemy.

I could not get it to work with a simple commandline invokation like "$ swift testing.swift"
despite the fact that this is how the video shows it working.

Putting it into a Swift Package got it running.

Note that the executable is s simple Hello World, the real target here is the unit test.

So From this diredtory doing:

$ swift build

then 

$ swift test 

runs the unit tests that demonstrate the pattern, and testing issues mentioned in the discussion.
